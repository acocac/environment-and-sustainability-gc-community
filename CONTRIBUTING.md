# CONTRIBUTING

This file describes what contributions we would like to this material and how people should get in touch. We aim to make it easy for people to get involved!

## Suggestions for content in the community pages
We are aiming for the E&S [community pages](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/environment-and-sustainability-gc-community/index.html) to contain all relevant material for community members to understand how the E&S GC operates, what is happening in the projects we are supporting, and ways they can connect with us. 

The material currently relates to Phase 1 of the E&S GC (period to March 2024). We are currently developing the structure and activities for Phase 2, and the documentation will be updated as soon as we have more information to share! It is designed to be used as a source of information for both internal (Turing) teams and anyone else who is interested! Some materials are restricted for access to Turing employees only, to maintain apprioriate privacy restrictions. 

We are aware that there are gaps in the material now, and we are practicing open and transparent development - sharing everything we can with you while we go along, and being honest about our journey! This is supported by version control of the materials using GitHub and open issues to track decision making! We hope you will support this work by sharing your perspectives on what you would like to see in this material!

**If you have a suggestion for material to be included in the community pages, please [open an issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environment-and-sustainability-gc-community/issues/new/choose). We'd love to know what it is you're looking to understand or contribute!**
