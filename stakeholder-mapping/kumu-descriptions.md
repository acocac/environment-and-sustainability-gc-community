# Project description (summary level info)

## Why are we building a stakeholder map?
We are working to uncover people and groups who are interested in data science for environment and sustainability, both in the UK and internationally. We have a commitment to support the growth impact, transparency, diversity, and collaboration within this community, through the development and sharing of best practices for equitable research. 

To achieve this, we need to understand the priorities of our community, what they care about and what infrastructure we can develop to facilitate their success. Importantly, we also need to identify people or groups who can contribute to the strategic direction setting of the community itself and our research activities.

**To do this, we need to know who the community are, develop appropriate messaging and processes to engage with them.**

## Why is this work important to us?
Professionalised and equitable engagement processes and routes to impact are part of the unique offering of the E&S GC, in line with the [values and strategy of the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/about-us/our-strategy), and made possible by our professional research infrastructure teams. A strategic, well managed, actionable and reportable stakeholder map will support the success of the programme by facilitating effective and efficient use of our expertise and resources to deliver our goals. 

We are documenting this project as we go, to capture our learnings and share the materials developed. We also provide a space for structured development and asynchronous contribution to this project - we welcome your contribution!

# Presentation slides 

## Slide 1: The Challenge

High-impact environmental events such as heatwaves, flooding and droughts are increasing in both frequency and magnitude. This threatens our planet, including the four billion people who live in cities and the rich biodiverse natural ecosystems from which life on earth relies on. 

To act on this we need to slow the pace of global heating, predict and mitigate climate impacts, and provide clear evidence to develop national and international policy to meet net zero targets.  

**We believe collaborative data science to be one of the most impactful ways to address this challenge.**

**We need to rapidly develop and disseminate best practice for  reproducible, ethical and collaborative data science, along with pathways for impact, leadership and researcher-lead mission development.**

We can only do this effectively and equitably if we understand the research and innovation ecosystem, so we're mapping it!

## Slide 2: Open Research Community Management

We want to know who is doing the research, what they are doing, and how we can support them. 

**Through the convening power of the Turing, we are creating opportunities for cross-project integration and leadership through professional research community management. We want to design these opportunities to fit your needs, and we can only do that if we know who you are!**

## Slide 3: Roadmap

We are currently in the *discovery* phase of this work - finding the people and developing the strategy to fit.

**We want to find more data scientists and projects active in environment and sustainability.**

You may already exist on our map! If so you will receive an email invitation to validate the data we hold about you, and consent to appear on the map. 

**If you would like to appear on the map you can complete this form: [Add yourself to this map!](https://forms.office.com/e/ws9EHtiLkV)**

## Slide 4: Explore the map

We are using this map as an internal planning tool, AND we want you to use it to find friends, colleagues, future collaborators, and routes to dissemination!

This version of the map in anonymised (people are labelled with a key). Names and contact information are only shared where we have received explicit consent. All stakeholders are being approached for consent as we speak - **we hope you will choose to share your details so we can all benefit from this network.**

You can use this map explore the projects, research institutions, non-profits, public and private sector organisations we know about. You'll notice that there are clusters of interest (lots of people around a single institution or organisation). We will explore way to maximise the value of engagement with such clusters, and all individuals throughout the community!

## Slide 5: How to navigate
Click the three vertical dots next to this panel to close the text and see more of the map.

### Clustering
Elements are brought closer to each other if they are connected. Connections are inferred from shared affiliations, or contributions to projects. Connections are our best route to dissemination and impact. 

### Zoom
Zoom in and out of the map using the "+" and "-". 

### Filter
Use the dropdown tools on the top left to filter the map by "type" (for example people only, non-profits only, or any combination). You can filter by "consent-kumu" to show only those individuals who have consented to public sharing of their contact information.

#### Example filtering 
Practice filtering using the top left controls on the map. Try filtering to show only people. See how the proximity between people changes when you include research institutes. Add in projects to see what activities have the broadest reach, and where we have opportunities to learn form each other. See what happens to our relationships when we remove the institutional boundaries!

1. "type-what = people". 
2. "type-what = people + research institutes". 
3. "type-what = people + research institutes + projects". 
4. "type-what = people + projects". 

### Showcase
"Showcases" keeps all elements, but  highlights the features ticked. 

### Search
Use the search bar to find a person (if they have consented to their data being made public!) or name of the institution or organisation they are affiliated with. Try looking for our Research Community Manager: "Cassandra Gould van Praag". The element will be brought to the centre of your screen.

### Metadata
Click on any element, then on the three dots to show the information we hold about them. This includes URLs

### Connections
Hover over an element to showcase the other elements it is connected to. Connections are inferred by affiliation or project contributions
