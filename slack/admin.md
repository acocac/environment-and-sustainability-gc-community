## Pinned messages

### #general
> Hi :wave::skin-tone-2:! This "Turing Environment and Sustainability" slack workspace is the central location where members of the Turing’s Environment and Sustainability Interest Group and Grand Challenge Communities can meet, discuss, plan and work together :rocket::earth_americas:. We welcome you to participate, listen, discuss, and contribute!
This is #general channel (for general conversations) — you can also join #welcome (to introduce yourself), #jobs (to share job opportunities, internships, fellowships) and #random (for memes etc.),
Please get in touch if you'd like to chat about how this workspace can best serve your needs! I'd love to hear from you!

When we have regular community offerings (e.g. community call), details of these will also be pinned in #general

## Creating new channels
We have intentionally kept the number of public channels low for now, to condence the conversation space. We expect to set up and host new channels (by member request or consultation) as the community matures. This may include the formation of Special Interest Groups, following an agreed governance structure see for example [the approach used by CSCCE](https://www.cscce.org/community/sigs/)
