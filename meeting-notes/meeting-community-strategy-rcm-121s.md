# Meeting 2024-06-07 (Cass' thoughts)
## Objectives for Community Management to April 2025
- Community members should:
    - 1. Know who we are
    - 2. Know what we're working on
    - 3. Know how we operate
        - Community strategy, inc how to contribute
        - best practice (TTW, RCM training)
            - Open (as open as possible, as closed as necessary)
            - Reproducible
            - Collaborative
        - handbook
            - Governance
            - Operations
        - How we're learning/improving/reflecting on the GC as a Programme
            - Reflexive exercises
    - 4. Know how they can contribute
        
- How will we measure these?
    - Baseline and going forwards
        - Survey
            - Likert scale (strongly disagree - strongly agree) + "I know where to find this information"
                1. *I know who we are*
                2. *I know what we're working on*
                3. *I know how we operate*
                    - Governance
                    - Operations
                    - Community
                    - Reflexive learning and development of the GC
                4. *I know how I can contribute to the E&S GC*
                    - Research
                    - Community
                    - Build, measure, learn, adjust
- What is our USP?
    - Why should people engage?

## RCM goals
1. Embed open, inclusive and reproducible research practices
2. Ensure a shared understanding of goals, roadmap, processes
3. Facilitate stakeholder engagement and collaboration
4. Provide technical support and domain expertise
5. Co-create, maintain and communicate project resources
6. Amplify and champion community learnings and achievements

## Implmentation
- All activities should hit one or more of the community objectives
- Devliery should be alogned with RCM goals

### Activites
#### Monthly Community Call
#### Quarterly in-persons
#### Community Pages
#### Project reflexive exercises
- Pre and post


# Meeting 2024-06-07

## Attendees
- Cass
- Nathan Simpson

## Apologies
- none

## Notes
- AI4NPW 
    - Decision making was difficult
    - miro with feedback from the team with this stuff in!!!
        - ==Nathan will arrange for Cass to have access==
        - Turing REG, Researchers, PMU
    - REG refelctions exercise - snark hunt!
        - [snark hunt](https://alan-turing-institute.github.io/REG-handbook/docs/how_we_work/snark_hunts/)
            - list of all previous ones here
            - ==Nathan will chase for the one from AI4NWP==
            - Facilitated by someone from REG each time, someone not on the project
- Value of doing these exercises
    - Processes, efficiencies, impact
    - ==Cass email Nathan asking for a summary of their perceived value in REG==
        - qualitative is fine
        - some specificity
        - case study, but with no depth

- Scott is PI for Phase 2 (and Phase 1)
    - Kirstine Met Office counterpart
- AI4NWP events
    - Don't know when collaboration agreement will be signed
    - 1st July end of phase 1 event, phase 2 planning and development
        - Turing and Met Office people
        - Monica
        - REG
        - Marc D, Scott, Ben M
        - Celebration
        - Maybe at Met Office? Turing is location in meeting invite

- OCF Resources
    - [Slides](https://thealanturininstitute-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/g/personal/nefremova_turing_ac_uk/EQVxKRcZAdtNjqqBgPweckoBj5Qirv0kip3HMecQrdBn7A?e=1JPay6)
    - [Baskerville form](https://hackmd.io/@phinate/baskerville-ocf)
    - This project was a finailist
        - finalists get 1 year funding
        - after 1 year all finalists will be reviewed
        - Turing is backing it as a high priority
- Pre-snark?!
    - Concerns going in
    - Project timeline ([slide 18](https://thealanturininstitute-my.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/personal/nefremova_turing_ac_uk/Documents/Cloud_prediction_project_overview.pptx?d=w1729710501194ddb8eaa8180fc1e724a&csf=1&web=1&e=x3IaFF)) is unreaslitic
        - May has not been achieved
        - Technical level scoping
            - Vague and not clear how the story ties together
            - Don't see how to get the goal by "doing diffuction models for 2 months"
            - No justification for time allocation
            - **Roadmap - REG should contribute**
            - Medium to short term goals to keep people focused
    - Being technically unfocued in previous proejcts
        - Spend time thinking about what to do, rather than doing
        - overlap
        - demotiviating - not contrbuting in a meaningful way to the work you're doing

# Meeting 2024-05-24

## Attendees
- Ruth Bower
- Cass

### Apologies
- none

## Notes
- Everything that's going on at Turing is hard to follow
- Adopted by UA - there are some amazing people on the team (Jen, Stuart)
    - they're not quite fitting into any GC
    - As an interdisciplinary researchers, the capacity to work in the between space is really important
- Always found it hard to "tie everything up" at Turing, even when bigger FTE
- Turing is different from academia
- Not a research seminar for everybody (whole Turing, or each GC)
    - Important opportunity for people to know what other people are doing
    - getting feedback can be risky! - This is done well at Turing with the TPS teams - not combatitive
    - See what other people are doing, where there is cross over in work
    - Done weekly, everyone does one every 2 years! Summer recess
- Leadership with fractional FTE means they aren't involved in the day-to-day
    - Lack of integration between junior and senior people
    - Conencting the community with management is disjointed
- its top down and bottom up
    - amazing people at middle levels, but who has oversite/final say
        - Lots of people working very hard but towards the same goals!
    - Shouldn't always be top down - with great power comes great 
    - Figure head should have vision and strategic goal
        - Follow the same river but allowing them to follow their own tributories
    - Consensus decision making is great, but there has to be a framework for it and a clearly definaed ultimate goal.
- Over promise had been made to the stakeholders (by leadership), and the team were getting heat for not delivering.

### Stop, start, continue
- help you feel you have a handle on it!
    - Who is in the challenge, what they are woring on, who they are, what the ultimate goals are
    - Don't know where to look for it, if it exists!
    - Marc B has a plan of where he wants it to go, but he's also not invoved in the decision making.
        - "Lots of Politics going on"
- The direction they're going in (keeping off grants) doesn't feel collaborative
    - This is how academics collabotrate!
    - Ruth and Stuart presented at Kings Public Health Seminar 
        - everyone was really excited! But we could get Turing to fund it!
    - Did get email from Donna
        - Turing isn't being open about what they want to support
        - Everyone is in stasus
        - ECRs will be worring about 
        - Colleagues at Kings would be completely baffeled by this!
            - How is Turing going to support research roles?
            - Long term core funding is great! Perminant contracts would be great
            - "If the goal of the org is reasearch and you're not applying for research grants"
- Most common question about Turing: "what do they do?!"
    - I don't know!
    - Is the Turing's role to be doing research in Data Science and AI, or pushing the boundries


- The lack of participation in grants
    - Feels very exclusive
    - Turing doesn't need other academic intiture and expertise
        - We are all made better by collaboration
        - Read it as a big, long term stop
        - Feedback from Turing: "We need to be moving beyond grants as a form of funding"
            - Turing wants to be an industry partner who doesn't work with academics

#### Community pages
- really helpful to anchor people within a community
- Understand what's going on outside the immediate project work
- In line with open science
- Why is there such secrecy?
