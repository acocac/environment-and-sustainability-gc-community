# Meeting yyyy-mm-dd
## Attendees
## Apologies
## Notes
- Hard to know how we're (CEH) fitting into things
- Feel like we've been less involved in the discussions around the GC
- Aim was to provide some steer
- Turing Fellow, but not involved in any discussion about anything
- Was not ht ecase before - felt like I was ingaged
    - Interviewing
    - Turing fellow reviews
    - Doing my bit, helping Turing get where it want's to go 
- GC discussion
    - approach was: ASG Jon didn't claim knowledge of the environmental area
    - Scott worked with the partner insitutes, becasuwe we have access to data, knowledge of the broad research requirement, capacity for data science and partnership increasing capacity/skills, linked with methods dev. Our own funding to take forward.
    - Matt as key contact, but doens't have muich knowledge of biodiveristy
    - Massive amount of activity in BD - National monitoring and capability, a lot of AI work (AMBER = CEH)
    - Rationalle - partners were;nt contributing (funding, recognition) - hope that wasn't thought of us - we were putting in leg work and research => frustrating
    - AIBDM - Matt picked up when Jon Siddorn stepped back - totally outside his interest, but did it to make things work - Post docs empliyed (Thjis), working well
    - The plug pulled, last minute, including support we could give to Thijs - poor way to treat him - Matt put in a lot of work - Marc and Scott agreed they will carry on 
    - Understand that they want to wait, but seems crazy when it was well planned and people were employed
    - Worry about how people are being treated
    - CEH money pulled - Â£350k pull was. a massive impact on their finances
    - Talked about whether they should ever partner again - not a lot of trust
    - Projects thrown at you last minute
    - Not felt very well planned or strategic
    - Agreed an upade of the collaboration agreement
    - No one else at Turing was looking after Thijs. Worried that Noushin would have no-one looking after their interest

- How would you like the GC to be operating
    - When Mission are running - plan to allow people to discuss how they can contribute
    - What we've got to offer
    - Can't just tell us what to do
    - Knowledge of what is appropriate or not appropriate
    - Scott and Marc don;t know about Hydrology, they should be seeking experts
    - Emulators might not be appropriate in this area
    - Marc said he wan't to focus on less generic areas, more applied, and always ways to link up
    - Needs a lot more bottum up and longer term thinking - requirements and methids in different domains, and how it can fit together (CEH work was not included)

- What would you need in place to contribute?
    - Know where want things to go
    - forums for discussion
    - More in-person meetings
        - Information disemination takes longer
    - Not just Matt as Turing lead (he doesn't know about diversity) - but he knows about what else goes on at CEH, so can connect people
    - Biodiversity - included time for David Roy and others to be involved, and they were never asked
    - Haven't been invited to previous researcher meetings - have been now
    - Marc's short update meeting - useful to get his thoughts, but needs to be more discussion
- Biodiversity work - said going to get someone else in to lead it - suprised that they can advertyise it with a blank slate
    - Little need for "short to medium term forcasting" - little need for that. It's not like wind generation or flodding. It's about longer term change and what the drivers are. 
        - If they want to have some direction onf that before they put it out, they should involve some people
        - Thrashing out ideas - lose outline in order to decide the tyepe of advert - have a discussion with partners.
- How do we decisde the 4th mission?
    - Lots that CEH do in flooding, drought prediction
        - methods wise, would be interesting to think about how they apply to hydrology
    - Not advers to a top down approach if you do it in the right way
        - Defined priorities aligned to other funding
        - National scake policy requirements
        - Where do we want to focus our efforts, methods wise
        - What else can we build on at Turing for best impact, what body of work could we build on?
        - If we decide Net Zero is the opportunity, invote us in to have discssion to take forward opportunities which are currently being developed?

### Who do think is part of the E&S community?
- Change of approach came as the QQR
    - This was saying Truing needs to be more of a place which hosts community, not research projects. Feels like it's not going that way
- CEH is National Capability - we're supposed to suppoert research
    - We've got researchers "in competition" with universities, and providing national capability - we tread that line
        - Increasingly going down support
        - Hard for people to know that you've got the knowledge to do this properly unless people beloive you at the cutting edge
    - What does UKAI need from Turing?
        - Providing fora for people to get together
        - Brokering AI methods 
- All the TTW stuff gets really well seen
    - CEH was looking at AI strategy - felt they should be taking this approach
        - Conviening that community
        - Developing generic methods fits, but is very hard to do
- Linking up with NERC investments in infrastructure
    - Help inform NERC in how to develop it's data in ways which help community
        - But these things are less sexy or have less massive research impact
- CEH has got good links with government
    - Didn't hear 
    - DEFRA has a huge range of means around producing biodiversity metrics
        - 25 year envronment plan
        - Waht could we do to support UK environmental progrtess
        - Understand where they are struggling, and where we have opportunities to support them.
            - Research and operational requirements






### What is the purpose of community?

### What is your vision for the E&S community?

        - May has not been achieved
        - Technical level scoping
            - Vague and not clear how the story ties together
            - Don't see how to get the goal by "doing diffuction models for 2 months"
            - No justification for time allocation
            - **Roadmap - REG should contribute**
            - Medium to short term goals to keep people focused
    - Being technically unfocued in previous proejcts
        - Spend time thinking about what to do, rather than doing
        - overlap
        - demotiviating - not contrbuting in a meaningful way to the work you're doing

# Meeting 2024-05-24

## Attendees
- Ruth Bower (Researcher)
- Cass

### Apologies
- none

## Notes
- Everything that's going on at Turing is hard to follow
- Adopted by UA - there are some amazing people on the team (Jen, Stuart)
    - they're not quite fitting into any GC
    - As an interdisciplinary researchers, the capacity to work in the between space is really important
- Always found it hard to "tie everything up" at Turing, even when bigger FTE
- Turing is different from academia
- Not a research seminar for everybody (whole Turing, or each GC)
    - Important opportunity for people to know what other people are doing
    - getting feedback can be risky! - This is done well at Turing with the TPS teams - not combatitive
    - See what other people are doing, where there is cross over in work
    - Done weekly, everyone does one every 2 years! Summer recess
- Leadership with fractional FTE means they aren't involved in the day-to-day
    - Lack of integration between junior and senior people
    - Conencting the community with management is disjointed
- its top down and bottom up
    - amazing people at middle levels, but who has oversite/final say
        - Lots of people working very hard but towards the same goals!
    - Shouldn't always be top down - with great power comes great 
    - Figure head should have vision and strategic goal
        - Follow the same river but allowing them to follow their own tributories
    - Consensus decision making is great, but there has to be a framework for it and a clearly definaed ultimate goal.
- Over promise had been made to the stakeholders (by leadership), and the team were getting heat for not delivering.

### Stop, start, continue
- help you feel you have a handle on it!
    - Who is in the challenge, what they are woring on, who they are, what the ultimate goals are
    - Don't know where to look for it, if it exists!
    - Marc B has a plan of where he wants it to go, but he's also not invoved in the decision making.
        - "Lots of Politics going on"
- The direction they're going in (keeping off grants) doesn't feel collaborative
    - This is how academics collabotrate!
    - Ruth and Stuart presented at Kings Public Health Seminar 
        - everyone was really excited! But we could get Turing to fund it!
    - Did get email from Donna
        - Turing isn't being open about what they want to support
        - Everyone is in stasus
        - ECRs will be worring about 
        - Colleagues at Kings would be completely baffeled by this!
            - How is Turing going to support research roles?
            - Long term core funding is great! Perminant contracts would be great
            - "If the goal of the org is reasearch and you're not applying for research grants"
- Most common question about Turing: "what do they do?!"
    - I don't know!
    - Is the Turing's role to be doing research in Data Science and AI, or pushing the boundries


- The lack of participation in grants
    - Feels very exclusive
    - Turing doesn't need other academic intiture and expertise
        - We are all made better by collaboration
        - Read it as a big, long term stop
        - Feedback from Turing: "We need to be moving beyond grants as a form of funding"
            - Turing wants to be an industry partner who doesn't work with academics

#### Community pages
- really helpful to anchor people within a community
- Understand what's going on outside the immediate project work
- In line with open science
- Why is there such secrecy?
