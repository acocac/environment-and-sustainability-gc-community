### Icenet as a potential template for designing other systems
- Arctic and antarctic are significant influencers in the global climate system - need to understand the influence 
- wide impact
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.38.42](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1lRfsNHT.png)
- Icenet is designed to enable and lower the barrier to sea ice forcasting
- Flexible system which drives complexity
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.40.03](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rke7miNBa.png)
- Generalisable library which offers capactity into the future
- The library offers the ability to produce many analytical assets - not just forcasting, but monitoring how effective the system/forcasts are
- Aligned to the UNIX philosophy (2 of 4)
    - Make one thing, and make it do that thing well
    - Think of every output you have as a potential input to something else
- The library has to facilitate incorporating new AI methods with the understanding that there will be new adaptation.
- Many layers to "the onion"
    - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.42.48](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/S17amjVrT.png)
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.43.04](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJXCXs4H6.png)
- We can flexibly adapt to new applications. 



### Reproducible pipelines
- Reducing maintainance and lowing barrier to adoption
- Pipelines can be scaled out without reproducing effort
    - configurable with minimal coding
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.45.26](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rkWw4jVH6.png)
- Clear interface at "data in" and "data out"
- Pipeline implementation denotes the method of execution 
    - bash scripts can be put on any hpc with remote execution
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.46.33](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BkSiEjESa.png)
- Outputs are ==CF compliant?==. Acts as an egress interface for other infrastructure
- Pipleine is implicit documentation. Notebooks show how the parts interact with eachother. 
- We can apply the template for pipelineing across the GC
- We currently have pipelines in:
    - Polar routing and planning. Optimised reseource usage across two ships.
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.50.13](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BybtHjESp.png)
    - Ice sheet emulation. Emulator coupling saves compute.
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.51.00](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Hky2BsVBp.png)
    - Earth observation data. Opens up areas we can sense directly (biodiversity and sea ice characterisation)
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.52.39](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJzz8j4ST.png)
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.53.19](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyiVLsNBT.png)
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.53.39](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJArUiNra.png)
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.54.58](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1RqLj4HT.png)
    - Remote sensor networks. Command and control is extreemly challenging (lack of physical comms so have to build for autonomy). Deep Sensor is will designed for interoperability.
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.56.29](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HktgPiEST.png)
        - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.57.00](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJDMvsEBa.png). 
- We are building repro pipelines to make research available in operational contexts, promoting further research and minimising effort for new implementation.
- Software enginerring which responsible, sustainable and fit for the furture.
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 11.59.01](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/By-5voVS6.png)
- The full impact story is wrapped in infrastructure


### Infrastructure
- Provide the underlying hardawre, software and experience to share pipleine consistently
    - Further research
    - operations
    - dissemination (e.g. policy)
    - analysis
    - education
- Infrastrucutre cannot be developed per project! We need to generalise for scale.
- Consideration of use cases
    - Users might not want/need all the technical infrastructure details
- enables consistent and ==[FAIR]()== sharing of digital assest
- IceNet pipleine is modular and under constant developmennt. Underlying cloud infrastructure is consistent.
- Driven by our end users at WWF and ==[Nunavut]()==
    - ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 12.04.03](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkkTds4Sa.png)
- Maximised efficiency in piplines by ising same common data stores to reduce implementation burden.


### Where next
- Generalisable principles are key to environmental digital twins
- Adopts ==[IMFe]()== - due diligance framework
    - Consistent application of this ensures interoperability
    - Top-down guide to bottom up development
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 12.07.22](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/H1HYKj4Sp.png)
- ==[EDS]()== (NERC) - how everything can interoperate between NERC data centres
- Opportunity to engage researchers on the engineering side - there are lots of tools they can adopt or adapt - for capacity building in RSE
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-29 at 12.09.08](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/B1leciNSa.png)
- Common capabilities and community development requires communcation
- Make is easy to align to existing efforts from the outside (e.g. NERC strategy)
- Opporational context use means we are making big (impactful) decisions
- Showcase end-to-end solutions and how they can be reused
    - Lots of onions talking to eachother ;)
    - Systems of systems, without onerious implementation

Onion emoji: ðŸ§… :100: 

## Questions
(please add your questions here - you are welcome to include your name!)
- Cass: name "IceNet" should be more generalised? And how do we integrate?
    - Draw a simple diagram :). Power lies in simplification. Look at other projects for commonalities and talk to people with your conceptual flow chart. Ensure modularity (refer to your flowchart!) so people can understand the sets and potentially interoperable assets.
- Matt Fry: Does the workflow have tools to check things have run and to re-run things? 
    - Yes. The outputs are data and configuratiuons, so you can do supplementary trainging (or transfer learning) using your own outputs. 
    
- Matt Fry: Also, does it pick up previous model states and continue for a time-step, or is it data driven each time it runs (i.e. not dependent on previous runs and the outputs of them)? Or is that what you mean by configuration based?
    - 
- 
- Simon Rolph: Are you using 'off the shelf' pipline/workflow engines (eg. Airflow) and tools like common workflow language (CWL), or is it all bespoke?
    - No. We have experimented with things like airflow. Our interaction to host services is importnant. The workflow management systems are hosted services, which we don't want to depend on external services for implementation. This was an intentional separation of concerns. [Ensembling tool](https://github.com/JimCircadian/model-ensembler) also developed inhouse. Could be replaced by something off the shelf.

- Really interesting. I like the Unix philsophy and using bash for the plumbing. With Julia, we're seeing 10 or 100 times speed up over R for some apps. However the compiler lag can make Julia problematic in bash scripts. Do you have any work arounds please? Perhaps we should take offline? (Rob Blackwell)

- Rob Blackwell: What do people think about orchestration of reproducible pipelines? Should we "standardise" or recommend on approaches to make interoperability easier between our teams? (Rob Blackwell)
    - Automated runs is really importnant. Programming and software engineering are fundimentally different capabilities , each have best practice. How we arrive at consensus needs to come from community - community comes first - need to review before coming up with guidance

- Rob Blackwell: Should we make a clearer distinction between data science / data engineering and research engineering in building these architectures?
    - Yes, and collaboration. Personally against the "service provider" model of RSE. Everyone needs to learn skills and be willing to wear different hats. 
        - Scott: We are multi skilled in E&S and RSE is baked in - part of the proposal from the begining (cf being contracted out), with deep integration
    - Liaise with service providers to make sure you have underlying infrastructure to delivery of your proposal.

- Cass: what are the biggest barriers to implementation and adoption (across all levels)?
    - Time and communication! You are dealing with big scaling pipleines (growing impact!) - better data, better intelgence, better products - and this can happen if you are not prepared to scale. Share the understanding of what we can do once and well!

- Scott: There is a big move/interest/awarenss form funders that we have to now deliver solutions. Often the funding we recieve is for the initial implementation , and it's diffiucult to find funding to share the solutions for wider adoption. We really need to be thinking about delivering the end-to-end solutions. Turing has highlighted projects from this group, as we are putting things into the field. This is the vision - how does what we're doing now fit into the pipeline and how can we deliver it to the potential end users, sharing the lessons learnt! Excited for 2024 :)
    - This is a journey :)



## Comments

- Rob Blackwell - Good stuff James - really like the thinking and would love to share experiences and try to distill some best practice. (Your thinking is in advance of ours).

## Notes
- Started with an intro from Scott: ==[slides]()==
    - ==Call for presenters (next session 29th November)==
        - WS 1 Mission Scoping
        - ~~WS 2.1 DeepSensor~~
        - WS 2.2 DTs for Agriculture
        - WS 2.3 SciVision
        - WS 2.4 Reproducible pipelines
        - WS 2.5 Community
- Tom is now in his last week at Turing!
- Title: Machine learning and software for tackling diverse environmental prediction tasks
    - ==[slides]()==
 - The talk will showcase good examples of open-source software 
### Context
- Deep learning is no longer fringe in ES. Expected to continue to trend upwards in applications (indicated by paper titles)
- There has been a revolution in weather forcasting using machine learning in the last year
    - This has come soon than we thought it might!
- ==Cass: Check with Tom on sharing these slides and screen grabs==
    - Tom: No problem! Thanks! :D
- New paradigm development mapping over key publications: 
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 11.42.59.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/r1ATF3kQ6.png)
- [Turing-Met Office parnership](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/ai-numerical-weather-prediction-nwp-ai4nwp) (announced yesterday) will continue this line
- Most of this work has relied on reanalysis data
    - Robust
    - direct observations rather than inference
    - But these models are biased by our understanding of atmospheric physics and can have coarse data resolution
- Growing calls for machine learning that can handle the above challenges, e.g. sparse data.

### Algorithm options
- Missing data
    - ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 11.50.39.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rys9shyXT.png)
    - Need a model than can operate on sets of varying length.
- Convolutional neural process (ConvNP)
    - ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 11.51.44.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/rJoAsh1XT.png)

### ConvNP data fusion experiments
- ConvNP model outperforms whole suite of other processes ([Vaughan et al., 2022](https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/15/251/2022/))
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 11.56.11.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HyIkThJ7p.png)
- Sensor placement with a ConvNP
- [Anderson et al, 2023](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/article/environmental-sensor-placement-with-convolutional-gaussian-neural-processes/F466DBCE3FA1088E04335D98225FA572)
- ConvGNP finds better sensor placements
- [Code base](https://github.com/tom-andersson/deepsensor)
- Sim2Real used to pretrain on simulated data, then fine tune on real sparse data
    - Model uncertainty improves on fine tuning
    - Pre-training becomes less important the more observational data you have
    - ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 12.00.56.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/BJNZRhJXa.png)
    - Now available on ArXiv: [Sim2Real for Environmental Neural Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19932)
- Filling gaps on satellite data
    - Also outputs uncertainty measures

### DeepSensor Python Package
- Developed over the last 5 months of ASG research
- ![Screenshot 2023-11-01 at 12.05.02.png](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/Bksgy61QT.png)
- Allows user of the package to focus on the science questions as the package handles the wrangling etc!
- Hope to accelerate research by building an open source community, building and sharing feedback
    - research(ers!) improves the software, software improves the research!
- Schematic of pipleine

- Design principles
    - user friendly interface - makes it easier to understand
    - leverage existing libraries
    - infer sensible default hyperparameters for the model based on the data. If you don't override them, it will work out a good value.
    - extendable to further models - model agnostic name (e.g. not "ConvNP")
    - Modular
    - agnostic to DL library (pyTorch or TensorFlow)
- Code
    - Good coverage of unit tests! 
    - Continuous integration
- Community
    - Slack channel (google for link to join)
    - Fortnightly meetings
    - DeepSensor Gallery - use cases for users Jupyter Notebook ==[link]()==
    - Documentation
    - [all-contributors] tool to acknowledge contributions which are not code
    - Shout out to [Kalle Westerling (TPS, RAM)](https://www.turing.ac.uk/people/researchers/kalle-westerling) for setting up and wrap up!
    - This is just the beginning - looking for the community activities to grow!

- Challenges and future work

## Questions
(please add your questions here)
* Thanks Tom. Can you summarise relative merits / limitations for sparse vs dense observations, or any other way to consider in advance how well this would do for an application? (Matt F)
    * Answer: ConvNOP produces artifacts at ranges it has not been trained on. Can mitigate this by adding noise to the data, or pretraining. Works well when you have a lot of messy (multimodel, multiresolution). If you have data with a more limited rolution, you are better of with something which uses stronger assumptions about the data. 
* And what is on your priority list for future developments / applications?? (Matt F) 
* Could Conv NP be used in other applications? E.g. filling in the gaps in images (perhaps replacing blurry areas or occlusions)
    * Yes :-) see Fig 2: https://yanndubs.github.io/Neural-Process-Family/text/Intro.html - Cool!
    * be great to use NPs for environmental images - nice overlap between GC WS2.1 (DeepSensor) and GC WS2.3 (SciVision)
* How did you develop the good software development priorities (e.g. unit tests) and communnity infrastructure, and/or how useful do you think this has been or / will be to your self and others doing this work?
    * Answer: Heard of cases where people who caught huge bugs with unit tests! If you're reselaseing OS Software, you have a responsibility to your users! Our brains are not LLMs, and it's easy to forget how one part plugs into another! Sustainability: want DeepSensor to live on - community of users and future maintainers - unit tests are an amazing way of facilitating new features. Devloped through emphasis on good software practices in Turing :)


* You have a lovely code base (and test coverage!). Are you considering adding a wrapper via [`reticulate`](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/) to release a parallel `R` package? 
    * Answer: Tom will look into this - please raise it as an issue on the codebase!
        * We used this with [mogp-emulator](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/mogp-emulator), with the same motivations! (ah cool thanks -griff)

* There's a project within Urban Analytics with a lot of overlap called `clim-recal` I've just got involved with and I can think for an event we've got with the Met Office comming up we could see if it's feasible to apply this model to test alongside the others we've worked on.
    * Answer: Lots of potential for urban applications. As long as you have enought data, there should be reasonable chances of success!
    * Cool thanks. Again I'm quite new to this so my colleagues can give you a better sense of the history etc. but: https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/clim-recal
    * FYI: the lead on that works primarily in `R`, but a lot of the work has followed examples in a python project called [`cmethods`](https://github.com/btschwertfeger/python-cmethods)
