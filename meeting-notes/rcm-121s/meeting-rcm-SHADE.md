        - Co-design
        - Qual

    - ==Options for how Cass could engage== - done. 
        - Contirbution as a named collaborator confirmed with Turing grants team and Marc D. 
        - Support proposal sent via email to Federica Lucivero <federica.lucivero@ethox.ox.ac.uk> and Samuel, Gabrielle <gabrielle.samuel@kcl.ac.uk>:
            - "Upfront I can do about 0.5d/month (so a monthly meeting plus some pre-post activities), advising on the development of community strategy, tactics for delivering/measuring with efficacy of the strategy, and general advocacy for the work/activities. I won’t be able to directly support delivery (e.g. running of conferences), and for this I’d suggest you aim to write in a full-time community manager if possible. An aim of our own programme is to build capacity in community management, so this hire could engage with those capacity-building activities, but I would not be in a position to line manage them. I would however be able to connect them into other “community management communities”(!) to ensure they are not isolated and can upskill. Happy to talk more about the value of this role, and/or help you craft a JD."
