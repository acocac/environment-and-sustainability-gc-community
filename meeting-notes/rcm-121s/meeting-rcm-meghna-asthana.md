- Workshop
    - communicating between stakeholders
    - Atendees from government instutes
    - Partnership with KCL Policy Instiute
    - Participation was selective
        - Meghna told she would be good candidate
- What does Meghna want to do after the workshop?
    - Scoping climate policy contributions with Mat Corbet, as linked into E&S work
        - ==Flag our known links with gov agencies==
    - Digital Science and Society has E&S as a low priority at the moment
        - Also chatted with John Francis - they are looking more at AI regulation
    - Could write a stand alone grant for policy engagement
    - Or add on to one of our workplans
    - ==Suggest doing a blog post which can be used to publicise the work==
        - Frame around impact!!
    - Suggest MA connects inth TTW policy work!
        - Attending TTW Book Dash!
        - Shared Collab Cafe for bookdash planning happening today! Suggested MA looks into who has contributed to policy work in TTW already, she if she can connect with them in advance, review exisiting issues around policy etc.
- MA not only interested in Ocean stuff, would be happy to work in all E&S spaces.
- E&S GC right now: People who can run by themselves are excelling, and those who need a little more direction a being left behind
    - Uncertainty for RAs
        - transitioning bewteen projects =>3 month gap
        - Could have been writing/creating outputs during that time. It is damaging career prospects
- Agreed to have ongoing conversations/meetings with MA about this work
    - This is rcm directly supporting commuity-initiated activity
    - RCM agreed to promote MA's outputs (blog post, TTW contributions) with our stakeholders at government agencies, via appropriate mechanisms.
