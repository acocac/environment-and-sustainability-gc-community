## Attendees

- Kalle
- Aoife

## Apologies

## Notes
- Bottleneck tasks
    - mapping the sharepoint lists to dynamics CRM
        - cross talk between lists and dynamcis
    - people validating their data
        - MS From, transposed, currently manual, could be python
        - re-enter data from scratch - would be better to prepoulate something with the existing data we hold?
    - preparing data for kumu
        - pull down off sharepoint, then run my scripts on csvs
        - IT won't give us API access to automate update
            - August 2022 rejected a request to create an app for room booking
    - We're not using the Kumu API

- Its complicated!
- Really need MS API access to make it work
- Dynamics is a core part that we can't get away from
    - Its a big part of the value proposition for of the stakholder map for the Business team
- Kalle is using [streamlit]()
- We have sever internal lack of knowledge of how the MS ecosystem can be used effectively!
    - We need to raise the knowledge in the business of how to use microsoft products
    - Internal capacity building
    - We need help from a microsoft person!
        - Partnerships?
        - Linda Sheard <Linda.Sheard@microsoft.com>
        - Microsoft are keen to give input and help to paying cutomers! May be money available form them to upskill
        - Review existing relationships between REG-Azure
- Need to deliniate the process and problems

    - Available here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CC42nEJd1LbWV3fNsh2HdLSx1KmYUJhh/view?usp=sharing
- E&S has reached this point ahead of the other GCs and it is now a Turing 2.0 problem
    - Recording and reporting of outputs should happen on Dynamics, but it's not being used properly => James Aitken
    - Core capabilities as a big part of Turing 2.0!
    - Tie in with conveineing power
- ==Write a proposal to fix with levels of: 1. unacceptable; 2. acceptable; 3. preferred.==

### Notes
-Kumo; stakeholder mapping and network diagrams. Underlying data is table in sharepoirnt and import. 
Purple triabngle - researhc insturtur
Green - people 
Red - projects

Each person affilatied with projects / organisation

Internal and external versions, external is anonomised. 
Participation data can tag as level of interest. 
Data could live in tbale, however one of the values of Kumo is visualisations such as clusterings - e.g where people have shared projects, particpate in more events etc - therefore shares where people/orgs where there isn't much engagement. 
E&S have 1000 data points. Some manual stages, but looking to automate these. 

Online version https://tinyurl.com/turing-ES-map
Kumo allows you to make presentations. 
Aim for people to explore the map and use themselves e.g how to find collaborators. Call to ask the to validate their data or add - this is done via microsoft forms. 
Can only see people who have given consent.

Questions re Kumu - 
MS - access limit re internal. CGVP - DPAP with Kit, it's low risk data which is in public domain so can be shared internal. Need to create a free account with Kumu - we have a free educational licesne. If we grow further, likely will need a paid product. 
MS - where is the sharepoint list. CGVP - ##to share##
MS - partnerships; how to manage this list. CGVP - these are contacts rather than leads - so via slack, turing interest group rather than scraping the internet for leads. MC - good to see the bigger picture then use filters. 
MC - projects, are these Turing funded projects, some won't cont. so will need updating? CGVP - Inteested in all projects, Turing or not. Active useful, but if it's closed/paused - is still a connection and therefore useful. Dynamics - tried to use the CRM but didn't get much support, next part is we may replace these sharepoint list with dynamics; need upskilling for this.

MS - Impact side; could be a filter.

EW - AIUK discussions, donors interested in good projects they could invest in. They don't have the sense of community, could we put something together of the projects / community. What did it take to do this? 
CGVP - Dedicated time from CGVP, building the information informally. Bifg dumps from Slack/TIG - then created a process to collect this information. Other part of the work was the features
MC - Partners who interest?
Public Sector people less interested in sharing their data publiclly. 

RAM 
Look by project and see who we could reach out to, be potential users. 

Capture events too and who attended, rather than the CRM. 

Contacts vs connections

Action ==Harry to share rough cost to do the stakeholder mapping as well as amount in the EPSRC proposal==

https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environment-and-sustainability-gc-community/tree/main/stakeholder-mapping

Enjoyed - code from sharepoint to Kumu
Hardest - time/resource

Key to capture outputs / tools and show how they apply to work done / to be done.

# Meeting 2024-02-05 - kumu

## Attendees
- Cass
- Denise Bianco
## Apologies
- None

## Notes
- Cass does all the data processing/handline in sharepoint then upload to kumu
- Denise uses google sheets, but that limits the the funcitonality
- Working offline can add time to the process, but keep the processing in python for 

### Aims for Skills team
- Understanding stakeholder engagement
- Mapping the stakeholders
    - inc ones we dont work with activitly but how we can engage with them
    - Funding bodies, CDT
- ==Use Cass' tools and frameworks and apply to skills team mapping activities==
- enjoyed mapping exercises at digital catapult
- our. community is huge, and ourengagement strategy isn't well formed
    - where to start!
- We're oportaing in the same way as when we had a community of n=20
    - this isn't sustainable
- Doing a PhD on artists in STEMM
    - Skills transfer
- Data collection templates is probably a good place to start

# Meeting 2024-01-08

## Attendees
- Cass
- Alden

### Apologies
- none

## Notes
- Prioritise projects (rather than insitutions) as the key connection and data collection point
- Don't worry to much about influence-* etc yet, work on filling out the data (collecting folks associated with projects/interactions)
- Documentation with a view to TTW. Make sure to cover DPAP and tension around open/closed info in this activity.

### Kumu
Q cass posted on kumu slack: Hi Folks :wave::skin-tone-2::blush: . Is there a way to delete a metadata field en mass for all elements of a given type in a stakeholder map? For example, I have a field "pronouns" which is appropriate for the data type "people" but not for "companies"! Can I delete the field "pronouns" for all "companies" at the same time rather than individually for each element? Many thanks!

A: Yes. Assuming you're using Kumu's database and not a linked Google Sheet, follow these instructions...
Go to table view
Filter for Company (the element type)
Select the value in the Pronouns field for the top value and delete it
Right click on the (now) blank field and click "fill down"
Additionally, I'd recommend going into your custom fields management and turning off the Pronouns for Elements Type = Company so that  editors cannot erroneously enter values in the future (edited)
