## Marc's objectives
- Seminar series (monthly)
- comms
- Foster a sense of community and ensure activities are aligned with GC priorities for:
    - Turing Fellows
    - enrichment students
    - CDT students
    - PDRAs 
    - REG
    - <mark>Wranglers</mark>
    - <mark>PMU</mark>
    - TIG
    - UK AI Hubs (potentially)
- community-building and engagement activities
- best practice in responsible research
- contribute to impact framework (Y2)
- representing E&S (maybe later) <mark>this is a strong mechanism for getting the message out and engaging the right people</mark>


##### What

<mark>This will be a table with goal, activity, output, measures of success</mark>

Y1
- inclusivity (EDI) (how: values at away day culture carroselle | output: lab handbook | measure: values question from pulse survey)
- understand eachother (how: away day(s); stakeholder map; seminar series "know what others are doing"; comms "know the importance of eachothers work"; onboarding | output: events delivered, n participants etc | measure: likert - I understand the work of others in the GC, or I know where to find out about it easily)
- cross disciplinary (how: seminar series; big idea development?)
- transparency (how: open source best practice - minimum requirements training: github + contributing etc., issues, license, doi; | ouput: ways of working; communicate governance; open source training material/course (with new starters) | measure: zenodo community entries; n repos with required material)
- ways for people to contrubute (how: show people that we have listened via this work; open leadership in engagement activities | output: this strategy | measure: likert question; case (studies) of open leadership; engagement in events (these conversations influences all your work and comes back to Marc) - record on SHM)

<mark>something here about developing a baseline measure and getting the first one before the away day or asap</mark>

Y2
- foster collaboration (how: RCM training)
- user engagement (how: RAM training, impact framework)

## Understand eachother

### Seminar series

### Internal researcher meetings

### Onboarding

### stakeholder map
Transformation programme and community contributors. Embed in our workflow. Socalise.

**<u>Value Proposition 1</u>: We should collate the disperate groups of stakeholders in a national programme data science for environment and sustainability into a unified structure and map. In line with the [guiding principles of the Research Community Management (RCM) team](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/open-research-community-management/?tab=readme-ov-file#rcm-teams-guiding-principles), this map should be published and dissemainated so the community can understand the context in which they are operating and improve the visibilty of their projects to support impact. Importantly, this collation should include potential contributors to the Community of Use for research outputs (such as Private and Public sector organisations) which can act as valuable partners in growing the impact of this work, as facilitated by the [Research Application Management (RAM) team](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/research-application-management).**

We believe building and maintaining an accurate map of stakeholders in this work will support operational delivery of the missions, and 

Our first efforts have been to capture and collate members of the groups outlined above into a single database. This has been achieved through building a stakeholder map, visualised using [kumu](https://kumu.io/). See [Stakeholder mapping](../stakeholder-mapping/) for details of this process. 

Our [public stakholder map](https://cassgvp.kumu.io/alan-turing-institute-environment-and-sustainability) is now live.
